# Requirements For The Ideal VR Headset in Order of Priority
Target Specs and features of the headset should match a minimum of Meta Quest3.

## Comfort
This is by far the biggest. If you have to be constantly adjusting the headset to make it land just right on your head or it feels too heavy or takes too long to put on the head it going to be hard for people to get through this struggle. A company needs to focus on comfort as a first class feature or even the main feature of the headset. Even lighter than 185 if possible. Comfort is a major factor. There needs to be a company out there that will take comfort as their number 1 priority. We need a headset with the optics of the quest 3 but significantly more comfortable and lighter weight 

### Includes
- Light Weight
- Sweat and stain ready/resistant material. Think sweat, makeup or face creams
- Easy to show to other people. (Should have a mode or an attachment that makes it easy to show others with great comfort)
- It doesn't move around when active. It doesn't fall of when you jump too much and stays in the right place.
- It doesn't strain your face after an hour of use.
- It doesn't fog up or overheat your face when in high intensity use.
- It need minimal to no adjustment once correctly in place.
- - Slim headset allowing hands to come in front of the face for boxing like games.

## Time to Action
The amount of time that it takes a user starting by grabbing the headset all the way to being in a vr application playing or interacting with the intended application the user wanted to use should be minimal. In a phone this takes about 4 to 5 seconds from grabbing the phone to opening a browser to search online if the app is in your home page. VR should take about the same speed or no more than double this speed. Meta Quest3 is by far the fastest but still often takes more than twice the speed of a phone.
- No Updates every time you going to play. (If it is so important to update the headset then sell the Quest with a decent charging dock bundled and have it so it updates only at like 3 to 4 am on work days.

## Boundaries.
The best boundary update/solution will be the day that a user puts a headset on and launches an app and they don't even know boundaries were set up. This should be 100% automated after the first time setup and only modified if the user wants to modify it. 

## Fornite Like Connectivity/Platform.
Horizon is a huge miss it should have followed Roblox/Fornite/VrChat-like connectivity with better graphics. VR Developers should be focused on creating experiences on top of a platform created by a big company. This is where VR shines, interacting with other people in VR is unlike any other multiplayer game ever.  Also, it would make content discovery a massive boost. There could be demo/promotional material for standalone experiences within this platform. This leads me to my next point.
Accessing this type of platform should be one click away when you join. The platform should have all sorts of experiences like VRChat or Fortnite does.

## Content Discovery.
The Store works great if I am on a desktop computer but it is an awful way to discover VR content. VR content should be demoed and the trailer should be in VR. Put me inside the experience and let me see how it works. Every app that is serious on the store should come with a small demo and these demos should be all accessible easily from a Demo Section of the store. A 2D screen video sales 2D screen apps. A VR immersive experience or video sells VR apps.
