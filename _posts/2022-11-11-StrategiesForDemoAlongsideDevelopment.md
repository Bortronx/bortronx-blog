There is a need to work on particular features of the software as it 
progresses along and have separate brances for demos. 

The software needs to be built in a way that features can be demoed 
like a feature set library. We have one portal that on a single click 
show a specific feature working. Navigation between the portal and 
the individual feature showcase must be seamless.

Develop software as a series of plugins (feature packs. Then load 
different version of the same feature/plugins and turn off the other
version of the same that have already being used.

This way we can always show working features. Look into Unreal Game
Feature functionality. See the following
